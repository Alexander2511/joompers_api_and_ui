- clone it from the current repository to your local machine 
- install all packages and modules used in the project by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the Terminal of the Pycharm IDE

‚ñ∂Ô∏è To run tests for API:
- (all of them at once) use the command `pytest ./api/tests` in the Terminal of Pycharm 
- (specific one) use the command `pytest ./api/[name_of_specific_file_with_test.py]` in the Terminal of Pycharm
